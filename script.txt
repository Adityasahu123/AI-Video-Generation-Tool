Snap settles social media addiction lawsuit ahead of trial Snapchat's parent Snap has settled a social media addiction lawsuit just days before the landmark case was due to go to trial in Los Angeles. Terms of the deal were not announced as it was revealed by lawyers at a California Superior Court hearing, after which Snap told the BBC the parties were "pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner". Other defendants in the case include Instagram parent Meta, ByteDance's TikTok and Alphabet's YouTube, none of which have settled. The plaintiff, a 19-year old woman identified by the initials K.G.M., alleged that the algorithmic design of the platforms left her addicted and affected her mental health.
